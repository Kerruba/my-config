# Personal VIM configuration
This is just a repository to hold my experiments with `VIM` configuration file 

Every time I will find a new command, configuration, plugin, or anything interesting to me I'll
add it to this config.

This config file is created form the ground up. There are other repositories out there with all the configurations
already made. This is not the scope of this repository. This is just for learning purposes.
